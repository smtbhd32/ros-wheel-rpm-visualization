# ros-wheel-rpm-visualization
This ROS project includes C++ and Python scripts that subscribe to cmd_vel for robot linear and angular velocities, calculate wheel RPMs, and visualize them. Shared memory facilitates data exchange between scripts, while httplib sends data to external services. Matplotlib is used for real-time plotting of RPM values.
